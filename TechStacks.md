WebSocket vs Socket

 -WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex (two-way) communication between the client and server over a single TCP connection.

 -Socket (or Socket.IO in Node.js) is a library built on top of WebSockets that adds features like automatic reconnection, event-based communication, and fallback support for older browsers.
