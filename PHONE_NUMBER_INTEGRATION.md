    validator: function(v) {
      // Only accept Indian phone numbers
      // Format: +91XXXXXXXXXX or 91XXXXXXXXXX (10 digits after 91)
      return /^(\+91|91)\d{10}$/.test(v);
    },
    message: props => `${props.value} is not a valid Indian phone number! Must start with +91 or 91 followed by 10 digits.`
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints Updated

### **Registration:**
```http
POST /api/register
Body: { email, password, name, phone }
```

### **User Search:**
```http
GET /api/users/search?query=email_or_phone
Response: { _id, email, name, phone, profilePic }
```

## User Experience

### **Registration Flow:**
1. User enters name, email, phone, password
2. System validates phone number format
3. EmailJS sends OTP for verification
4. User verifies OTP and account is created
5. Phone number is stored for future call services
